anpr/alpr using python machine learning for cars and it is working for all worldwide vehicles..

prerequists:
 1.python have to be installed on your system if dont have installed it then click this link and download https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
 
 2.you must have installed with miniconda and jupyter notebook. if not then atleast you must have IDE like pycharm, eclipse and vs code..
 personally, i refer you to use jupyter notebook through miniconda. Here is the link to download jupyter notebook and miniconda https://jupyter.org/ and https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html 
 
 3.before all these software things, better have a good hardware like atleast 4gb ram, pentium and 500gb internal memory. if you can afford an efficient system then you can.
 
 4.get installed with packages like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, opencv, easyocr and tensorflow on jupyter.
