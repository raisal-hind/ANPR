# ANPR
anpr/alpr using python machine learning for cars and it is working for all worldwide vehicles..

ANPR stands for automatic number plate recognition.
ALPR stands for automatic license plate recognition. mainly used for detecting & recognizing the number from images.

prerequists:
 1.python have to be installed on your system if dont have installed it then click this link and download https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
 
 2.you must have installed with miniconda and jupyter notebook. if not then atleast you must have IDE like pycharm, eclipse and vs code..
 personally, i refer you to use jupyter notebook through miniconda. Here is the link to download jupyter notebook and miniconda https://jupyter.org/ and https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html 
 
 3.before all these software things, better have a good hardware like atleast 4gb ram, pentium and 500gb internal memory. if you can afford an efficient system then you can.
  

steps to be followed:

1.download the clear image from internet. or else use the images that i provided here. if you have images on your own hand then you it also. but it must be clear.
before using your own images just refer the images here for sample.

2.get installed with packages like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, opencv, easyocr and tensorflow on jupyter.
 
commands to install packages:
 
 pip install numpy
 
 pip install pandas
 
 pip install matplotlib
 
 pip install opencv-python (or) pip install cv2
 
 pip install easyocr
 
 pip install tensorflow
 
 just copy & paste the commands on jupyter notebook and run one by one


3.click the ANPR or ALPR.ipynb file, copy and paste the code as i did in jupyter. 

4.pass the correct path of your image in image = img.imread("give the exact image path")
and run the program as one by one tags.

5.focus on final tag and see the output is obtained or not. because There is the output shown.

6.use latest things like software/hardware for better expecting output/Result.
